# Phase 4 â€“ Mobile App Roadmap

Phase 4 will explore a companion mobile application. Early planning focuses on:

- Exposing REST endpoints required by a lightweight React Native app.
- Enabling push notifications for new events and organization updates.
- Providing offline access to bookmarked content.

The mobile roadmap is still in discovery and will commence after analytics and spam prevention tasks are stable.
