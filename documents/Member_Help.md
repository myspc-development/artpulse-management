# Member Help Guide

Artists and organizers can manage their listings through a set of self-service tools built into the plugin.

## Registration Forms
- Use `[ap_artist_registration_form]` or `[ead_organization_registration_form]` to create accounts.
- Registration pages collect basic details like contact information and profile images.
- Both shortcodes require the user to be logged in. `[ap_artist_registration_form]` is limited to members with the **Pro Artist** level, while `[ead_organization_registration_form]` requires an **Organization** membership. Administrators automatically bypass these membership checks.

## Dashboards
- After registering, members log in to their artist or organizer dashboard.
- Dashboards show upcoming events, favorite items and reviews.
- Once an artist is approved, any uploaded gallery images appear on their public profile.

## Submitting Events
- Organizers can create events from the dashboard or with the `[ead_submit_event_form]` shortcode.
- Events remain pending until approved by an admin.

## Reviews
- Visitors submit reviews using `[ead_reviews_form]` or `[ead_org_review_form]`.
- Members can respond to feedback directly from their dashboards.
