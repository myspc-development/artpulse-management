# Technical Specifications Rollout

To keep development aligned with the modular approach outlined in `dev-plan.md`, the rollout follows these technical guidelines:

- PHP 8.2+ with strict typing where possible.
- PSR-4 autoloading via Composer for all classes under `src/`.
- JavaScript bundled with Webpack and Babel for ESNext syntax.
- WordPress REST API secured with nonces and capability checks.
- Continuous integration planned via GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

Adhering to these specifications ensures a stable foundation as new phases are implemented.
