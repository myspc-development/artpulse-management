# Phase 2 â€“ Enhanced Experience Plan

Phase 2 centered on improving the user-facing directories described in `dev-plan.md`. Key deliverables included:

- Dynamic map filtering to help users discover nearby events and organizations.
- More robust CSV tools to simplify large data imports and exports.
- A member review system with moderation tools.
- Favorite lists so users can quickly reference artists or venues they follow.

These updates brought the plugin to a production-ready state and laid the groundwork for Phase 3's featured listings functionality.
