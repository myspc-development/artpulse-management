# Development Plan: Artworks Module

## Overview
This module manages individual artworks, which are linked to artists, events, and potentially organizations. It serves as a repository for visual assets and descriptive metadata.

## Features
- Create and manage artwork entries
- Attach images, descriptions, and technical metadata
- Link to artist and event entities
- Categorization (style, medium, status, availability)
- Track creation date, dimensions, and materials

## Planned Enhancements
- Artwork showcase/gallery views with filters and tags
- Sales integration or inquiry form (optional, future phase)
- Exhibition history and version tracking per artwork
- Status tracking (e.g., On Display, Sold, In Storage)
- Batch import/export (CSV/XML) for bulk curation
- Rights/license metadata fields
- QR code generation for physical tagging
- Admin review workflow for public submissions

## Technical Considerations
- Use custom post type for artworks
- Featured image + additional media support
- Store metadata using ACF, Metabox, or native WP fields
- Relationship mapping to artist and event CPTs
- Enable REST API support for frontend and external use

## UI/UX Plans
- Visual grid/gallery and list view toggle
- Editable detail view with image zoom/lightbox
- Bulk edit and batch upload features
- Artwork status indicators (color-coded or labeled)

## Testing Strategy
- Metadata validation and sanitization
- Display tests for galleries, tags, and detail views
- Cross-link integrity tests (artwork â†” artist/event/org)
- Access control tests for public/private listings
