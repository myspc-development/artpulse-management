# Custom Post Type Registration Plan

The initial phase of ArtPulse focused on registering the core Custom Post Types (CPTs) used throughout the plugin. These CPTs include Events, Organizations, Artists, and Artworks. Each CPT provides:

- Custom meta fields for rich information like dates, locations, contacts, and media galleries.
- REST API endpoints enabling external integrations and AJAX-based directories.
- Admin menus and capabilities mapped to WordPress roles.

This phase established the foundational data structures referenced by all later features outlined in `dev-plan.md`.
