# Development Plan: Payments Module

## Overview
Facilitates payment processing for memberships, event tickets, or other transactions using a gateway such as Stripe. This module connects financial flows with access control and content availability.

## Features
- Stripe integration (checkout, subscriptions, webhooks)
- Payment status tracking
- Link payments to users and memberships
- Sandbox/test mode support for development

## Planned Enhancements
- Multiple payment methods (e.g., PayPal, bank transfer)
- Discount codes, vouchers, and dynamic pricing logic
- Receipt and invoice generation with email delivery
- Refund and cancellation workflows
- Payment history dashboard for users and admins
- Organization-level billing with per-seat pricing
- One-time and recurring purchase support
- Admin override for manual adjustments and notes
- Integration with external accounting or CRM systems

## Technical Considerations
- Secure handling of API keys, tokens, and webhook secrets
- Store payment metadata in custom database tables or user meta
- Handle Stripe webhook events: checkout.session, invoice.paid, etc.
- Use custom post type or transaction log for full audit trail
- Ensure GDPR compliance and data retention settings

## UI/UX Plans
- Payment form with real-time validation and error feedback
- Admin view of transaction history with filters and exports
- User-facing receipts, invoices, and transaction history
- Status labels and retry/resend controls
- Graceful fallback UI for failed or incomplete payments

## Testing Strategy
- Webhook simulation and validation under test mode
- Status transition testing (pending â†’ success/fail/refund)
- Mock gateway integration for continuous integration (CI)
- Edge case handling (card declines, expired subscriptions)
- Manual testing for discounts, refunds, multi-method support
