# Development Plan: Membership Module

## Overview
The Membership module manages user subscriptions, roles, and access privileges based on their membership status. It forms the foundation for access control, feature availability, and monetization.

## Features
- Membership levels (e.g., Free, Pro, Enterprise)
- Role assignment on subscription
- Expiration and renewal logic
- Administrative overview dashboard
- Integration with payment gateways (e.g., Stripe)
- Notification system for expirations and renewals

## Planned Enhancements
- Membership upgrade/downgrade support
- Trial memberships with automatic conversion
- Membership level hierarchy (e.g., Guest < Member < Manager)
- Perks/feature flags per membership (stored as JSON or in config)
- Membership analytics and reporting
- Multi-membership or sponsor-based switching
- Auto-renewal toggle for users
- Discount code and dynamic pricing support
- Email/SMS renewal reminders and grace period logic
- Membership history log for auditing
- Integration with Organizations module

## Technical Considerations
- Store membership data in user meta (membership level, start/end, renewal preference)
- Use scheduled actions (cron) for expirations and notifications
- Track membership history as a custom table or post type (optional)
- Leverage WordPress roles and capabilities
- Ensure compatibility with multisite (if relevant)

## UI/UX Plans
- Dashboard widgets for admins (active members, expiring soon, growth rate)
- Member view with expiration date, plan details, and feature access
- Filters and bulk actions by level and status
- Public membership benefits comparison table

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for role assignment and expiration
- UI tests for membership dashboard and forms
- Mock payment gateway responses
- Test scheduled expirations and reminders
- Validate permission changes on upgrade/downgrade
