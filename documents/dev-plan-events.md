# Development Plan: Events Module

## Overview
This module manages events such as exhibitions, openings, workshops, and talks. Events can be linked to artworks, artists, and organizations and may be public or private.

## Features
- Create and manage events with metadata
- Link artists and artworks to events
- Event scheduling (start/end dates, time zones)
- Public and private event visibility
- Optional RSVP or ticketing system

## Planned Enhancements
- Calendar view and timeline integration
- Notification/reminder system for attendees and organizers
- Event analytics (attendance, views, conversion)
- Organization-hosted event support
- Recurring events (e.g., weekly tours, monthly exhibitions)
- Online/hybrid event metadata and streaming links
- Registration limits, waitlists, and confirmations
- Custom event types (e.g., Vernissage, Panel, Residency)
- Integration with Google Calendar/iCal exports
- QR code or pass generation for check-in

## Technical Considerations
- Store events as custom post types with event-specific taxonomies
- Use meta fields for schedule, venue, and links
- Link participants using post relationships or taxonomy
- Integrate RSVP/ticketing with external APIs or custom forms
- Structured data markup (JSON-LD) for event SEO

## UI/UX Plans
- Calendar and agenda views for public and admin sides
- Event creation/edit wizard with relationship auto-fill
- RSVP interface with real-time capacity updates
- Mobile-friendly event pages and listings

## Testing Strategy
- Date/time and time zone handling tests
- RSVP workflows and capacity constraints
- UI testing for calendar filters and views
- Relationship validation (event â†” artist/artwork/org)
