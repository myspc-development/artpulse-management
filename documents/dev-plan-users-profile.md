# Development Plan: Users Profile Module

## Overview
This module extends the user profile functionality to support custom fields, enhanced presentation, and integration with membership, organization, and artist data.

## Features
- Add custom profile fields (bio, avatar, social links)
- Display profile tab for logged-in users
- Public vs. private profile setting
- Link user profiles to roles, memberships, and organizations

## Planned Enhancements
- Admin-configurable custom field editor
- Social link and contact method integration
- Profile completeness indicator
- Integration with Artists module (profile becomes artist portfolio)
- Optional portfolio toggle per user (switch between public/private persona)
- Profile review and moderation workflow (for public display)
- Skill/tag system for user discovery
- Activity feed or latest contributions view
- Profile export (PDF or JSON)

## Technical Considerations
- Use user meta for storing custom data
- Hook into `show_user_profile`, `edit_user_profile`, and `user_register`
- Extend registration and edit forms on frontend (shortcodes or blocks)
- Respect privacy preferences in public and admin views
- Add REST API endpoints for external apps

## UI/UX Plans
- Profile tab on frontend with conditional display
- Editable layout with drag-and-drop fields (optional enhancement)
- Responsive design for profile display and editing
- Tabs for memberships, events, and artworks (if linked)

## Testing Strategy
- Form input validation and sanitization
- User meta read/write consistency across modules
- Privacy settings enforcement and visibility toggles
- Frontend and backend form rendering consistency
