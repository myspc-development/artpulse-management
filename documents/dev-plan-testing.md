# Development Plan: Testing & QA Module

## Overview
This module outlines the quality assurance practices to ensure stability, performance, and correctness across the system. Testing spans unit, integration, UI, and acceptance layers.

## Types of Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Validate isolated functions (e.g., role logic, date processing)
- **Integration Tests**: Validate module interactions (e.g., membership-payment linkage)
- **UI/Functional Tests**: Validate frontend forms, views, and interactions
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Simulate full user journeys
- **Regression Tests**: Prevent bugs from resurfacing after updates

## Tools & Frameworks
- PHPUnit for PHP unit testing
- WP_Mock for mocking WordPress functions
- Playwright or Cypress for UI testing (if applicable)
- GitHub Actions or other CI tools for automation

## Coverage Goals
- High-importance functions (e.g., payment processing, access control)
- Critical user flows (signup, login, purchase, content access)
- Plugin lifecycle (activation, deactivation, updates)

## Planned Enhancements
- Mock data generators for artists/artworks/events
- Snapshot testing for UI changes
- Performance profiling on critical pages

## QA Workflow
1. Code pushed to feature branch
2. CI pipeline runs tests automatically
3. Manual QA for UI-specific features
4. Merge to main only after review & all tests pass

## Responsibilities
- Developers write and maintain unit/integration tests
- QA team (or assigned reviewer) handles manual and exploratory testing
- Project leads ensure test coverage metrics are met
