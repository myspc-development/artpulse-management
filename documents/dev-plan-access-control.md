# Development Plan: Access Control Module

## Overview
Controls access to content and site functionality based on user roles, membership level, and organization affiliation. This module ensures users only access what their permissions allow.

## Features
- Role-based page access restrictions
- Redirect users based on role, membership, or status
- Restrict content visibility (e.g., premium content)
- Graceful handling of unauthenticated or unauthorized access

## Planned Enhancements
- Shortcode or block for conditionally protected content
- Admin UI for managing access rules per post or globally
- Logging and analytics for unauthorized access attempts
- Layered access control (role + membership + org)
- Time-gated content (release dates, expiration dates)
- Preview teaser content for non-members
- User role simulation tool for testing permissions
- Access tiers linked to Membership levels and Organization plans
- Integration with Events (e.g., member-only RSVP)

## Technical Considerations
- Use `current_user_can()` and custom capabilities
- Store access rules in post meta or via global settings
- Hook into `template_redirect` and content filters
- Fallback content/message system for blocked views
- Use WordPress REST API permissions for external gatekeeping

## UI/UX Plans
- Access settings panel in post editor (meta box or block)
- Global settings page for default access policies
- Customizable redirect messages and error templates
- Visual cues (e.g., lock icons) on protected content

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for rule evaluation logic and fallbacks
- UI tests for rule creation and application
- Role/membership/organization interaction scenarios
- Edge case handling (expired membership, orphaned role, etc.)
