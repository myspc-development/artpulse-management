# Development Plan: Artists Module

## Overview
This module will manage artist profiles, allowing them to be associated with artworks, events, and organizations. Artist profiles serve as a public-facing identity and a backend content-linking entity.

## Features
- Create and edit artist profiles
- Artist biography, portrait image, and contact links
- Link to artworks and events
- Categorization by genre, medium, or affiliation
- Associate artist with organizations (galleries, collectives)

## Planned Enhancements
- Public artist portfolio pages (with SEO options)
- Artist collaboration tagging (co-authors or collectives)
- Social media and website integration
- Artist dashboard showing events, artworks, profile stats
- Featured artists widget and ranking logic
- Request-to-claim profile flow (for pre-added entries)
- Admin review/approval system for new artists
- Version history for artist profile changes

## Technical Considerations
- Custom post type or user-linked custom object for artists
- Store metadata in post meta or user meta (bio, links, tags)
- Enable taxonomy terms (genre, region, medium)
- Link to artworks/events via post relationships or ACF/Metabox
- Support legacy/imported data mapping

## UI/UX Plans
- Artist directory with filters and search (by genre, name, org)
- Detail view with gallery and CV download (optional)
- Inline editing or frontend form submission
- Visual relationship map (optional, future phase)

## Testing Strategy
- Tests for profile creation/editing and validations
- Link integrity tests (artist â†” artworks, events, orgs)
- UI filtering and search functionality tests
- Permission tests (claimed vs. unclaimed profiles)
