# Development Plan: Organizations Module

## Overview
This module supports grouping of users into organizations (e.g., collectives, galleries, institutions), with shared access, administrative roles, and centralized billing.

## Features
- Create and manage organizations
- Assign users to organizations with roles (e.g., Admin, Member)
- Define roles within organizations
- Organization-specific settings
- Link organizations to memberships and billing entities

## Planned Enhancements
- Shared billing/account for organizations (covers multiple users)
- Organization dashboard for admins (members, billing, activity)
- Data export for organization activity (CSV, JSON)
- Invitation system with email workflows and join codes
- Organization membership plan management (bulk upgrades, per-seat pricing)
- Admin hierarchy (Owner > Manager > Member)
- API endpoints for managing organizations externally (e.g., external CRM)
- Sortable event table with status badges and quick links
- RSVP tracking integration in org dashboard

## Technical Considerations
- Store organizations as custom post types or in custom database tables
- Map users to organizations via meta table or relationship model
- Permissions system layered over WordPress roles (org_role + wp_role)
- Billing logic integrated with Membership and Payments modules

## UI/UX Plans
- Org creation and edit wizard (step-by-step)
- Member management with role assignment and filters
- Bulk invite or upload members via CSV
- Visual overview of membership usage and billing status
- Events table: sortable, filterable by status/date, with quick edit/view links
- RSVP summary per event, visible from org dashboard

## Testing Strategy
- Functional tests for org creation, deletion, and editing
- Role-based access and visibility tests
- Integration tests with membership upgrades and billing
- UI validation for member management workflows
