# Artists Directory Shortcode

Use the `[ap_artists_directory]` shortcode to output a responsive, accessible listing of published `artpulse_artist` profiles. The directory automatically groups artists alphabetically, presents an A–Z filter bar, and exposes each section through an `aria-live="polite"` results container so screen readers announce updates when visitors change letters.

## Basic Usage

Add the shortcode to any page or post:

```
[ap_artists_directory]
```

When the page loads, visitors see an alphabet filter bar and an "All" view that includes every published artist. Clicking or tapping on a letter filters the results client-side, while query parameters such as `?letter=B` keep the experience functional for visitors without JavaScript or for deep-linking to a specific letter.

## Optional Attributes

The shortcode accepts the following optional attributes:

- `orderby` – Field to order by (defaults to `title`).
- `order` – Sort direction (`ASC` or `DESC`, defaults to `ASC`).
- `posts_per_page` – Number of artists to retrieve (defaults to `-1` to show all artists).
- `letter` – Set the default active letter (for example `letter="C"`).

Example:

```
[ap_artists_directory orderby="title" order="ASC" posts_per_page="200" letter="B"]
```

## Customising Output

Developers can tailor the directory using these WordPress filters:

- `artpulse_artists_directory_args` – Modify the underlying `WP_Query` arguments before artists are fetched.
- `artpulse_artists_directory_fields` – Adjust the data displayed for each card (e.g., add organisation details, role, or location metadata).

The shortcode caches rendered artist data for 12 hours to keep the directory fast. Caches are automatically cleared whenever `artpulse_artist` posts are saved, trashed, or deleted.

## Front-End Behaviour

- The filter bar uses focusable controls with `aria-pressed` states for accessibility.
- The results grid (`.ap-directory-grid`) adapts to various screen sizes.
- Sections without matching artists are hidden with the `hidden` attribute, and a built-in empty state message appears when a letter has no results.

No additional configuration is required—enqueueing of the associated CSS (`assets/css/ap-artists-directory.css`) and JavaScript (`assets/js/ap-artists-directory.js`) happens automatically when the shortcode is present on a singular page.
